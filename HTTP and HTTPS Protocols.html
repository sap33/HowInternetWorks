    <div class="bg-dark text-white" style="padding-left: 1%;"><h4>HTTP</h4></div>
    <p>
        HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Within the internet protocol suite, HTTP is an application
        layer protocol to establish and improve the client-server communication between distributed, shared and
        hypermedia information systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        The communication is achieved by sending the HTTP requests and receiving the HTTP responses over www (world
        wide web).
    </p>
    <div class="class-img-margin">
        <img src="images/HTTP1.jpg" class="mx-auto d-block">
    </div>
    <p>
        A client (say, a web browser) sends an HTTP request to the web server (say, a cloud computer). The server
        receives the request and executes an application to process the request. It then returns the application
        execution output i.e. HTTP response to the client. The client receives the response.
    </p>
    <div class="class-img-margin">
        <img src="images/HTTP2.jpg" class="mx-auto d-block">
    </div>
    <p>
    <p><i class='fas fa-hand-point-right'></i><strong style="padding-left: 0.5%;">HTTPS</strong></p>
    <p>
        HTTPS, developed by Netscape, is stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. The limitation with HTTP is that
        the flow of information between client and server is not encrypted and thus anyone can steal the information.
    </p>
    <p>
        The hypertext exchanged using HTTP travels as plain text and anyone can easily read it or inject their own code
        if intercepts the communication for their own benefits. Thus, HTTPS was developed to overcome this security of
        limitation of HTTP.
    </p>
    <p>
        The ‘S’ at last of HTTPS is known for ‘Secure’. HTTPS is an extension of HTTP to enable secure communication
        across a computer network and is broadly used on the internet. HTTPS = HTTP + cryptographic protocols. HTTPS
        also falls in the application layer of the Internet Protocol suite.
    </p>
    <div class="class-img-margin">
        <img src="images/HTTP3.png" class="mx-auto d-block">
    </div>
    <p>
        HTTPS provides bidirectional encryption between client and server i.e. it encrypts and decrypts the browser
        requests
        and server responses which in turn provides protection against man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping, and
        tampering of the message.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, HTTPS basically provides authentication of the accessed website and protects the privacy & integrity of data
        in
        transit during client-server communication. It assures secure communication.
    </p>
    <div class="class-img-margin">
        <img src="images/HTTP4.jpg" class="mx-auto d-block">
    </div>
    <p>You must have observed a padlock icon like below when you open the web browser like Chrome, IE or any other.</p>
    <div class="class-img-margin">
        <img src="images/HTTP5.jpg" class="mx-auto d-block">
    </div>

    <p>his lock icon tells that the HTTPS connection is in effect.</p>
    <p>
        HTTPS initially came to use in the financial domain, for example, in online payment transactions like online
        banking
        and online shopping.
    </p>
    <p>
        But in recent times, it is being widely used in almost all type of websites so that the authenticity of the web
        data
        is protected, user’s account and browsing information can be secured and kept private.
