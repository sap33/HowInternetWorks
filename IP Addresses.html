    <p>
        IP address stands for internet protocol address; it is an identifying number that is associated with a specific
        computer or computer network. When connected to the internet, the IP address allows the computers to send and
        receive information.
    </p>
    <p>
        • An internet protocol (IP) address allows computers to send and receive information.
        • There are four types of IP addresses: public, private, static, and dynamic.
        • An IP address allows information to be sent and received by the correct parties, which means they can also be
        used to track down a user's physical location.
    <p><strong>How an IP Address Works</strong></p>
    <p>
        An IP address allows computers to send and receive data over the internet. Most IP addresses are purely
        numerical, but as internet usage grows, letters have been added to some addresses.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are four different types of IP addresses: public, private, static, and dynamic. While the public and
        private are indicative of the location of the network—private being used inside a network while the public is
        used outside of a network—static and dynamic indicate permanency.
    </p>
    <p>
        A static IP address is one that was manually created, as opposed to having been assigned. A static address also
        does not change, whereas a dynamic IP address has been assigned by a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
        server and is subject to change. Dynamic IP addresses are the most common type of internet protocol addresses.
        Dynamic IP addresses are only active for a certain amount of time, after which they expire. The computer will
        either automatically request a new lease, or the computer may receive a new IP address.
    </p>
    <p>
        An IP address can be compared to a Social Security Number (SSN) since each one is completely unique to the
        computer
        or user it is assigned to. The creation of these numbers allows routers to identify where they are sending
        information on the internet. They also make sure that the correct devices are receiving what is being sent. Much
        like the post office needs a mailing address to deliver a package, a router needs an IP address to deliver to
        the
        web address requested.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What is IPv4?</strong></p>
    <p>
        IPv4 was the first version of IP. It was deployed for production in the ARPANET in 1983. Today it is most widely
        used IP version. It is used to identify devices on a network using an addressing system.
    </p>
    <p>
        The IPv4 uses a 32-bit address scheme allowing to store 2^32 addresses which is more than 4 billion addresses.
        Till
        date, it is considered the primary Internet Protocol and carries 94% of Internet traffic.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Features of IPv4</strong></p>

    <p>• Connectionless Protocol</p>
    <p>• Allow creating a simple virtual communication layer over diversified devices</p>
    <p>• It requires less memory, and ease of remembering addresses</p>
    <p>• Already supported protocol by millions of devices</p>
    <p>• Offers video libraries and conferences</p>

    </div>
    <p><strong>What is IPv6?</strong></p>
    <p>
        It is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol. Internet Engineer Taskforce initiated it in early 1994.
        The
        design and development of that suite is now called IPv6.
    </p>
    <p>
        This new IP address version is being deployed to fulfill the need for more Internet addresses. It was aimed to
        resolve issues which are associated with IPv4. With 128-bit address space, it allows 340 undecillion unique
        address
        space. IPv6 also called IPng (Internet Protocol next generation).
    </p>
    <p><strong>Features of IPv6</strong></p>

    <p>• Hierarchical addressing and routing infrastructure</p>
    <p>• Stateful and Stateless configuration</p>
    <p>• Support for quality of service (QoS)</p>
    <p>• An ideal protocol for neighboring node interaction</p>

    <p><strong>Example of an IP Address</strong></p>
   <p>
    The dark web refers to encrypted online content that is not indexed by conventional search engines. The dark web has
    an illegal online black market where criminals can deal illegal and illicit goods. Many of these exchanges take
    place using the online cryptocurrency bitcoin, which makes it harder for the authorities to track and capture people
    participating in these transactions.
   </p>
    <p>
    In 2018, after a yearlong government operation, agents working with the Department of Homeland Security posed as
    weapons dealers in order to gain access to the computers of suspects who were trying to purchase weapons illegally.
    This allowed them to gain access to IP addresses, which they used to track down the geographical locations of
    additional suspects who were using the dark web.
    </p>
   <p>
    This isn’t the first time IP addresses have led to arrests. In 2012, police used IP addresses to track down and
    arrest members of the hacking group Lulzsec. Using warrants to obtain information from the Internet Service Provider
    (ISP), law enforcement personal were able to track down the physical addresses of the hackers and arrest them for
    their illegal internet activity.
