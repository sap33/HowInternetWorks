        <h1>Internet Website History</h1>
        <hr>
        <strong>1973</strong>
        <p> Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is designed and in 1983 it becomes the standard for
            communicating between computers over the Internet. One of these protocols, FTP (File Transfer Protocol),
            allows users to log onto a remote computer, list the files on that computer, and download files from that
            computer.</p>

        <strong>1976</strong>
        <p> Presidential candidate Jimmy Carter and running mate Walter Mondale use email to plan campaign events.
            Queen Elizabeth sends her first email. She's the first state leader to do so.</p>

        <strong>1979</strong>
        <p>Usenet came into being in late 1979, shortly after the release of V7 Unix with UUCP. Two Duke University grad
            students in North Carolina, Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis, thought of hooking computers together to exchange
            information with the Unix community.</p>

        <strong>1982</strong>
        <p>The word “Internet“ is used for the first time.</p>

        <strong>1988</strong>
        <p>A virus called the Internet Worm temporarily shuts down about 10% of the world's Internet servers.</p>

        <strong>1989</strong>
        <p>The World (world.std.com) debuts as the first provider of dial-up Internet access for consumers.
            Tim Berners-Lee of CERN (European Laboratory for Particle Physics) develops a new technique for distributing
            information on the Internet. He calls it the World Wide Web. The Web is based on hypertext, which permits
            the
            user to connect from one document to another at different sites on the Internet via hyperlinks (specially
            programmed words, phrases, buttons, or graphics). Unlike other Internet protocols, such as FTP and email,
            the
            Web is accessible through a graphical user interface.</p>

        <strong>1990</strong>
        <p>The first effort to index the Internet is created by Peter Deutsch at McGill University in Montreal, who
            devises
            Archie, an archive of FTP sites.</p>

        <strong>1991</strong>
        <p>Gopher, which provides point-and-click navigation, is created at the University of Minnesota and named after
            the
            school mascot. Gopher becomes the most popular interface for several years.
            Another indexing system, WAIS (Wide Area Information Server), is developed by Brewster Kahle of Thinking
            Machines Corp.</p>

        <strong>1994</strong>
        <p>The White House launches its website, www.whitehouse.gov.
            Initial commerce sites are established and mass marketing campaigns are launched via email, introducing the
            term
            “spamming“ to the Internet vocabulary.
            Marc Andreessen and Jim Clark start Netscape Communications. They introduce the Navigator browser.</p>

        <strong>1995</strong>
        <p>Internet Search engines took place. Yahoo, Explorer
            Sun Microsystems releases the Internet programming language called Java.
            The Vatican launches its own website, www.vatican.va.</p>

        <strong>1996</strong>
        <p>Approximately 45 million people are using the Internet, with roughly 30 million of those in North America
            (United States and Canada), 9 million in Europe, and 6 million in Asia/Pacific (Australia, Japan, etc.).
            43.2
            million (44%) U.S. households own a personal computer, and 14 million of them are online.</p>

        <strong>1997</strong>
        <p>On July 8, 1997, Internet traffic records are broken as the NASA website broadcasts images taken by
            Pathfinder
            on Mars. The broadcast generates 46 million hits in one day.
            The term “weblog“ is coined. It's later shortened to “blog.“</p>

        <strong>1998</strong>
        <p>Google opens its first office, in California.</p>

        <strong>1999</strong>
        <p>College student Shawn Fanning invents Napster, a computer application that allows users to swap music over
            the
            Internet.
            The number of Internet users worldwide reaches 150 million by the beginning of 1999. More than 50% are from
            the
            United States.
            “E-commerce“ becomes the new buzzword as Internet shopping rapidly spreads.
            MySpace.com is launched.</p>

        <strong>2002</strong>
        <p>As of January, 58.5% of the U.S. population (164.14 million people) uses the Internet. Worldwide there are
            544.2
            million users.
            The death knell tolls for Napster after a bankruptcy judge ruled in September that German media giant
            Bertelsmann cannot buy the assets of troubled Napster Inc. The ruling prompts Konrad Hilbers, Napster CEO,
            to
            resign and lay off his staff.</p>

        <strong>2003</strong>
        <p>It's estimated that Internet users illegally download about 2.6 billion music files each month.
            Spam, unsolicited email, becomes a server-clogging menace. It accounts for about half of all emails. In
            December, President Bush signs the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of
            2003 (CAN-SPAM Act), which is intended to help individuals and businesses control the amount of unsolicited
            email they receive.
            Apple Computer introduces Apple iTunes Music Store, which allows people to download songs for 99 cents each.

            Apple Computer introduces Apple iTunes Music Store, which allows people to download songs for 99 cents
            each.</p>

        <strong>2004</strong>

        <p>On September 26, Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook) spoke during the 70th annual U.N. General Assembly session, to
            increase awareness and garner support for the initiative, ONE--an organization "taking action to end extreme
            poverty and preventable disease." Zuckerberg's goal is to bring the Internet to the masses; universal
            Internet
            access, he claims, is a basic human right and is an essential tool in the fight to achieve global justice.
            Sources for this timeline include International Data Corporation, the W3C Consortium, Nielsen/NetRatings,
            and
            the Internet Society.</p>
