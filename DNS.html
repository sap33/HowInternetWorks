    <p>
        The <strong>Domain Name System (DNS)</strong> is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain
        names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS
        translates
        domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device. DNS
        servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.1.1 (in IPv4), or more complex
        newer
        alphanumeric IP addresses such as 2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2 (in IPv6).
    </p>
    <p><i class='fas fa-hand-point-right'></i><strong style="padding-left: 0.5%;">How does DNS work?</strong></p>
    <p>
        The process of DNS resolution involves converting a hostname (such as www.example.com) into a computer-friendly
        IP
        address (such as 192.168.1.1). An IP address is given to each device on the Internet, and that address is
        necessary
        to find the appropriate Internet device - like a street address is used to find a particular home. When a user
        wants
        to load a webpage, a translation must occur between what a user types into their web browser (example.com) and
        the
        machine-friendly address necessary to locate the example.com webpage.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to understand the process behind the DNS resolution, it’s important to learn about the different
        hardware
        components a DNS query must pass between. For the web browser, the DNS lookup occurs “ behind the scenes” and
        requires no interaction from the user’s computer apart from the initial request.
    </p>
    <p><i class='fas fa-hand-point-right'></i><strong style="padding-left: 0.5%;">There are 4 DNS servers involved in loading a webpage:</strong></p>
    <p>
        • <strong>DNS recursor : </strong> The recursor can be thought of as a librarian who is asked to go find a particular book
        somewhere
        in a library. The DNS recursor is a server designed to receive queries from client machines through applications
        such as web browsers. Typically the recursor is then responsible for making additional requests in order to
        satisfy
        the client’s DNS query.
    </p>
    <p>
        • <strong>Root nameserver : </strong> The root server is the first step in translating (resolving) human readable host names into
        IP
        addresses. It can be thought of like an index in a library that points to different racks of books - typically
        it
        serves as a reference to other more specific locations.
    </p>
    <p>
        • <strong>TLD nameserver : </strong> The top level domain server (TLD) can be thought of as a specific rack of books in a library.
        This nameserver is the next step in the search for a specific IP address, and it hosts the last portion of a
        hostname (In example.com, the TLD server is “com”).
    </p>
    <p>
        • <strong>Authoritative nameserver : </strong> This final nameserver can be thought of as a dictionary on a rack of books, in
        which a
        specific name can be translated into its definition. The authoritative nameserver is the last stop in the
        nameserver
        query. If the authoritative name server has access to the requested record, it will return the IP address for
        the
        requested hostname back to the DNS Recursor (the librarian) that made the initial request.

    <p><i class='fas fa-hand-point-right'></i><strong style="padding-left: 0.5%;">The 8 steps in a DNS lookup:</strong></p>
    <p>
        1. A user types ‘example.com’ into a web browser and the query travels into the Internet and is received by a
        DNS
        recursive resolver.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. The resolver then queries a DNS root nameserver (.).
    </p>
    <p>
        3. The root server then responds to the resolver with the address of a Top Level Domain (TLD) DNS server (such
        as
        .com or .net), which stores the information for its domains. When searching for example.com, our request is
        pointed
        toward the .com TLD.
    </p>
    <p>
        4. The resolver then makes a request to the .com TLD.
    </p>
    <p>
        5. The TLD server then responds with the IP address of the domain’s nameserver, example.com.
    </p>
    <p>
        6. Lastly, the recursive resolver sends a query to the domain’s nameserver.
    </p>
    <p>
        7. The IP address for example.com is then returned to the resolver from the nameserver.
    </p>
    <p>
        8. The DNS resolver then responds to the web browser with the IP address of the domain requested initially.
        Once the 8 steps of the DNS lookup have returned the IP address for example.com, the browser is able to make the
        request for the web page:
    </p>
    <p>
        9. The browser makes a HTTP request to the IP address.
    </p>
    <p>
        10. The server at that IP returns the webpage to be rendered in the browser (step 10).

    <p><i class='fas fa-hand-point-right'></i><strong style="padding-left: 0.5%;">Types of DNS queries:</strong></p>
    <p>
    1. Recursive query - In a recursive query, a DNS client requires that a DNS server (typically a DNS recursive
    resolver) will respond to the client with either the requested resource record or an error message if the resolver
    can't find the record.
    </p>
    <p>
    2. Iterative query - in this situation the DNS client will allow a DNS server to return the best answer it can. If
    the queried DNS server does not have a match for the query name, it will return a referral to a DNS server
    authoritative for a lower level of the domain namespace. The DNS client will then make a query to the referral
    address. This process continues with additional DNS servers down the query chain until either an error or timeout
    occurs.
    </p>
    <p>
    3. Non-recursive query - typically this will occur when a DNS resolver client queries a DNS server for a record that
    it has access to either because it's authoritative for the record or the record exists inside of its cache.
    Typically, a DNS server will cache DNS records to prevent additional bandwidth consumption and load on upstream
    servers.
    </p>
    <p><i class='fas fa-hand-point-right'></i><strong style="padding-left: 0.5%;"> What is DNS caching? Where does DNS caching occur?</strong></p>
    <p>
    The purpose of caching is to temporarily stored data in a location that results in improvements in performance and
    reliability for data requests. DNS caching involves storing data closer to the requesting client so that the DNS
    query can be resolved earlier and additional queries further down the DNS lookup chain can be avoided, thereby
    improving load times and reducing bandwidth/CPU consumption. DNS data can be cached in a variety of locations, each
    of which will store DNS records for a set amount of time determined by a time-to-live (TTL).
    </p>
    <p><i class='fas fa-hand-point-right'></i><strong style="padding-left: 0.5%;">Browser DNS caching</strong></p>
    <p>
    Modern web browsers are designed by default to cache DNS records for a set amount of time. the purpose here is
    obvious; the closer the DNS caching occurs to the web browser, the fewer processing steps must be taken in order to
    check the cache and make the correct requests to an IP address. When a request is made for a DNS record, the browser
    cache is the first location checked for the requested record.
    </p>
    <p>
    In chrome, you can see the status of your DNS cache by going to chrome://net-internals/#dns.
