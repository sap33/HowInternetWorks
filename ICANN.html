    <div class="bg-dark text-white" style="padding-left: 1%;"> <h5>ICANN</h5></div>
    <p>
        ICANN, which stands for Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, is a non-profit organization that
        was established in the United States in 1998 to help maintain the security of the Internet, and allow it to be
        usable by all. Anytime you register a domain on the Internet, you go through a domain name registrar, who pays a
        small fee to ICANN to register your domain as part of the domain registration process.
    </p>
    <p>
        While ICANN doesn’t control what content goes on the Internet, meaning it cannot regulate Internet access or
        help to stop spam from occurring, it does help keep the web safe by developing and enforcing policy on the
        Internet’s unique identifiers. These unique identifiers are the name and number that you type into the address
        bar when conducting a search for a given site. The address for that site has to be unique so computers know
        where to find each other.
    </p>
    <p>
        By helping to coordinate these unique identifiers all over the world, ICANN allows us to have a global Internet.
        In doing so, ICANN also helps promote competition on the web and plays a vital role in the expansion and
        evolution of the Internet.
    </p>
    <p><strong>How is ICANN related to the Domain Name System?</strong></p>
    <p>
        There is a system that exists to make the Internet accessible to human beings. This system, called the Domain
        Name System, or DNS, makes it easier for us to remember a web address, or IP address.
    </p>
    <p>
        An IP address is a complex series of numbers that each correlate to a different device, however, it would be
        quite difficult for a human to remember these long lists of numbers. The DNS steps in to convert these numbers
        to a series of letters instead. The IP address links this series of letters to the precise series of numbers.
        When this conversion is done, you can find a given website with its name, rather than a seemingly random series
        of numbers. The computers still communicate with each other and know the address by these numbers, but for
        humans, we just need to remember to Domain.com, for example.
    </p>
    <p>
        The DNS, therefore makes it much easier for people to use the Internet. It also prevents a domain from being
        tied to one specific computer, since it is easy to change a particular domain and IP address. When a change
        occurs,, it takes the entire Internet less than 48 hours to recognize the change because the ultra-flexible DNS
        infrastructure is constantly updating.
    </p>
    <p>
        A domain is comprised of two elements, including what comes before and after the dot. What comes to the right of
        the dot, such as a “com,” “org,” or “net,” is what is known as a top-level domain, or TLD. For each particular
        TLD, there is one company, or registry, that is in charge of all domains that end with that specific TLD. This
        registry has access to the full list of domains that are directly under that name, in addition to any IP address
        with which those names are associated.
    </p>
    <p>
        The part before the dot is likely the name of your company, or organization, and is the domain name that you
        register. This domain is used for your website, email, and more.
        The DNS, therefore, makes it possible for people to find particular websites on the Internet, through the
        information provided during the domain name registration process. Email and many other online uses are also
        based upon this system.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What does ICANN have to do with root servers?</strong></p>
    <p>
        There are thirteen root servers in all, meaning, more technically, that there are thirteen IP addresses where
        root
        servers can be found. These servers that have one of the thirteen IP addresses can be located in dozens of
        different
        physical areas of the web. However, all of these servers store a copy of the same file that acts as the main
        index
        of the Internet’s address books. Each top-level domain has an address listed where you can find that registry’s
        address book.
    </p>
    <p>
        Root servers are not consulted very frequently, since once it is known by computers on the network, the address
        of a
        top-level domain is retained. They only check back in occasionally to make sure that the address has not
        changed.
        However, root servers are still an important piece of the Internet and help to keep it functioning smoothly.
    </p>
    <p>
        The operators of the root servers are able to remain largely autonomous. However, they still need to work with
        each
        other and make sure the system stays up-to-date with ICANN and the changing Internet.
        What is ICANN’s primary purpose?
    </p>
    <p>
        The main role of ICANN is to make the Internet run smoothly all over the world. This is more commonly known as
        “universal resolvability.” This term means that you get the same results when you access the network, no matter
        where you are in the world. This gives us one Internet, rather than an experience that works differently
        depending
        on your location.

    <p><strong>ICANN decision-making process?</strong></p>
    <p>
    Since ICANN has a pretty important job to do, you may be curious about how they go about making changes to the
    Internet.
    </p>
    <p>
    The supporting organizations suggest changes to the current network, or bring up any concerns that they or an
    advisory committee identifies. These changes are discussed, and eventually, a report is created and released for
    public review. When the suggested changes impact another group within the ICANN system, that group is given the
    opportunity to review the suggested changes and offer opinions on the matter. This group’s views are then released
    to the public, as well.
    </p>
    <p>
    Each of these reviews is put into a single report that is put before the ICANN Board of Directors, including a list
    of recommendations based on the feedback. The Board then goes over the list, and either approves or denies the
    changes. The Board can approve all changes, or approve some and deny others, or even perhaps deny the entire
    proposal. Often, the issue is sent back to one of the supporting organizations involved, with an explanation of what
    needs to be amended before the matter can be approved.
    </p>
    <p>
    The process repeats until every group involved, and the Board of Directors, can agree to a compromise or a final
    decision on the report is made.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Keeping the Internet open</strong></p>
    <p>
    ICANN serves a primary role in the efforts to keep the Internet open for all. It does this through its model of
    multi-stakeholder control, although some have expressed concerns about ICANN operating as an independent body,
    fearing that no single business, government, or individual should be in control of the Internet.
    </p>

    <p><strong>ICANN helps to keep your website online</strong></p>
  <p>
    As you can see, ICANN plays a pivotal role in maintaining the Internet as we know it and continues to mold and
    evolve the Internet of tomorrow. Anytime you register a domain, ICANN gets a small piece of the fee, and oversees
    your domain to help maintain the security of the web.
