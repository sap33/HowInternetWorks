    <p>A <strong>domain name</strong> is your website name. A domain name is the address where Internet users can access your website. A
        domain name is used for finding and identifying computers on the Internet. Computers use IP addresses, which are
        a series of number. However, it is difficult for humans to remember strings of numbers. Because of this, domain
        names were developed and used to identify entities on the Internet rather than using IP addresses.
    </p>
    <p>A domain name can be any combination of letters and numbers, and it can be used in combination of the various
        domain name extensions, such as .com, .net and more.
    </p>
    <p>
        The domain name must be registered before you can use it. Every domain name is unique. No two websites can have
        the same domain name. If someone types in www.yourdomain.com, it will go to your website and no one else's.
    </p>
    <p>
        A domain name is an essential part of having a website, but it's only part of the equation. In order to launch a
        website, you'll also need content and a hosting service to store your files so they can be accessed on the
        internet. Remember that owning a domain does not mean hosting is also included.
    </p>
    <p>
        Professional emails at your domain name can also help you boost your credibility and build your brand. For
        example, info@yourdomain.com can make your website seem more trustworthy and legitimate.
    </p>
    <p><i class='fas fa-hand-point-right'></i><strong style="padding-left: 0.5%;">Why you need a Domain Name</strong></p>
    <p>
        On the Internet, your domain name is your unique identity. Any individual, business or organization planning to
        have an Internet presence should invest in a domain name. Having your own domain name, website and email
        addresses will give you and your business a more professional look. Another reason for a business to register a
        domain name is to protect copyrights and trademarks, build creditability, increase brand awareness, and search
        engine positioning.
    </p>
    <p>
        With Website.com's premium plans, as a domain name is one of the most crucial tools to build your reputation, we
        include your custom domain name in your plan for free.

    <p>
        Domain (e.g., oberlo.com) is the web address you buy from a domain registry. Subdomain (e.g., blog.oberlo.com)
        is a subset of a domain that can be created by a domain owner.

    <p><i class='fas fa-hand-point-right'></i><strong style="padding-left: 0.5%;">Domain Name Types</strong></p>
    <p>
        Top-Level Domain (TLD) refers to the suffix or the last part of a domain name. There’s a limited list of
        predefined suffixes which includes:
    </p>
    <p> • .com – commercial business (the most common TLD)</p>
    <p> • .org – organizations (typically, nonprofit)</p>
    <p> • .gov – government agencies</p>
    <p> • .edu – educational institutions</p>
    <p> • .net – network organizations</p>
    <p> • .mil – military</p>
    <p> TLDs are classified into two broad categories: generic top-level domains (gTLDs) and country-code top-level
        domains (ccTLDs).
    </p>
    <p> Generic Top-Level Domain (gTLDs) is a generic top-level domain name that identifies the domain class it is
        associated with (.com, .org, .edu, etc).
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
        Country Code Top-Level Domain (ccTLD) is a two-letter domain extension, such as .uk or .fr, assigned to a
        country, geographic location or territory.
        nTLDs refers to new top-level domain names that are geared towards brands organizations and services, as they’re
        more customized, flexible and relevant. Examples of nTLDs include “.voyage”, “.app”, “.ninja”, “.cool”, etc.
    </p>
    <p><i class='fas fa-hand-point-right'></i><strong style="padding-left: 0.5%;">How to Choose a Domain Name?</strong></p>

    <p>  • Choose a name that’s easy to type and pronounce. If people struggle to spell it or pronounce it correctly, it
        will affect the memorability of the name and hurt your brand.</p>
    <p>  • Pick a domain name that can be turned into a brand. You don’t want exact and partial keyword match domain
        names because they’re too generic and very difficult to brand. You should also steer clear from numbers and
        hyphens in your domain name – they’re too difficult to remember and pronounce.</p>
    <p>  • Keep it short and simple. Long, complex domain names run a huge risk of being mistyped and misspelled. That’s
        just an unnecessary headache.</p>
    <p>  • Avoid names that can be confused with existing brands. If you think you can piggyback on some other brand’s
        success, you’re hugely mistaken. Brand confusion will be the least of your concerns when you get sued!</p>
    <p>  • Use an appropriate extension. With the new TLDs rocking the internet, you’d think everyone’s going for
        something as eye-catching as “.boutique”. Yet the prevailing advice among marketers is to stick to the old good
        “.com”, merely because it’s the most recognized suffix outside the tech world. If you’re targeting a local
        market, then ccTLDs is probably a better choice for your business.</p>
    <p>  • Choose a name that indicates what your business does. You must be careful not to get too literal. But a clever
        domain name that suggests to consumers what they can expect to find when they land on your site is a great
        advantage to any business.</p>

    <p><i class='fas fa-hand-point-right'></i><strong style="padding-left: 0.5%;">Where Can You Buy a Domain Name?</strong></p>
    <P>
        You will need to pay an annual fee to register a domain name. When the registration period expires, you will be
        given the option to renew. If you don’t, the domain name will be made available to others.
        There are quite a few domain name registrars out there, but godaddy.com and NameCheap are probably among the
        most popular ones. Shopify also offers an option to buy a domain name through them for those opening a new
        e-store.
