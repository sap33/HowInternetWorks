        <h1>Internet Search</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Imagine a world without Google, seriously a world without Google a world where you couldn't do detailed
            reconnaissance on your blind date for tomorrow night. Few years ago there was no Google and before that
            there was no way at all to search. Internet and that posed a big problem because really what hust was the
            world wide web if you couldn't navigate it and get where you want it to go. After that the companies that
            took a stab at search included some of the most iconic names in the history of the net like Yahoo, Excite
            and many more before Google.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yahoo it was only two people the business model. It was to be generous hazing to figure out a way to make
            money somehow and up to that point we had no revenue at all actually it was worse than that at the time no
            one on planet Earth had figured out how to make money. On the internet but Yahoo would change all that and
            in doing so helped launch the gold rush that would soon the Gulf the web in 2007. Search companies such as
            yahoo and google generated billions of dollars in revenue and profits making them the envy of entrepreneurs
            everywhere but at the dawn of the web no one used it for business or commerce. The very idea was considered
            heretical even evil by some. The web tried to define its culture in the mid-1990s the center of the web
            culture wasn't in Silicon Valley it was here in this little park on the south edge of San Francisco just up
            the street Wired magazine and its online sister hot-wired were launched. The arguments around the impending
            commercialization of the web were fierce and they boiled down to just one word advertising advertising split
            the early web community on one side were venture capitalists and other financial types figure that the
            internet was a new kind of medium and media had always been supported by advertising.
        </p>
        <p>
            Late in 1995 Yahoo began taking banner ads. This gonna work the agonizing turned out to have been in vain
            Yahoo's users just kept on multiplying and more users meant more advertisers paying more money to put their
            banner ads in front of the growing number of eyeballs for the first time. Yahoo had shown it was possible to
            make money on the web it was a crucial moment in the story and it meant one thing the web boom had begun. It
            was almost like a starting gun went off and the race by 1996 yahoo faced an assortment of challenges that
            were gaining ground on it in physique AltaVista Lycos but Yahoo's most formidable rival was a company called
            excitement superficially Excite seemed an awful lot like Yahoo it was another search startup founded by
            another bunch of burrito-eating. Stanford kids substituting a ratty suburban house pro-rata on-campus
            trailer but the technology that excite developed was considerably more sophisticated than that developed by
            Yahoo rather than a list of sites. Compiled and sorted into categories by human beings excite was pure
            software when you type in your query the service would crawl the web finding pages that contain the term
            you'd enter it was that is a rudimentary version of what we think of a search.
        </p>
        <p>
            By 1997 the internet was exploding as millions people flocked online to see what all the excitement was
            about companies like Yahoo, excite and the other. Search engines were busy turning themselves into what were
            known as portals one-stop destinations. Jam packed with diversions from stock tickers to email to chat rooms
            they were online carnivals filled with an array of glittery enticements and trinkets and baubles designed to
            turn users into a captive audience. For the benefit of advertisers it caused people to engage in really
            extreme innovation extreme competition and in a very extreme and unsustainable way to live there's
            definitely. Yahoo would launch personalization Yahoo, would launch email also. Yahoo search to write a book
            on figures.
