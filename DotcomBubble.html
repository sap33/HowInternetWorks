        <h1>Dotcom Bubble</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>In 21st century humans have come up with an awful lot of entertaining ways of filling up the few free moments
            in our over schedule wives we see and dance we surf and ski week aboard and canoodle and watch TV but what
            diversion do we love most of all nano man we love to spend now some folks say our obsession with shopping
            reflects a certain decadence a certain self-indulgence but I say every time we whip out a piece of plastic
            and slap it down to buy some fresh bling-bling we're taking part in a noble tradition the evolution of
            capitalism but now a new phase of capitalism is upon us the age of e-commerce an age that change the way the
            business works the way we buy and sell an age assured in by a transformative technology the world wide web
            and by two of its seminal companies amazon.com and eBay it's easy to forget just how revolutionary these
            companies were when they first burst upon the scene back in the 1990s how they shook big business to its
            very core ever since the Industrial Revolution corporations have always been based on the power of
            high-flying executives sitting in their gilded offices way up there with the consumer almost as an
            afterthought but now Amazon and eBay were creating a whole new model of commerce one based on taking the
            internet and harnessing the power of the great mass of individuals down here at street level.</p>

        <p>This is about the high-tech innovations that underpin that revolution and about the enormous economic
            upheaval that it unleashed it's a story of a boom a bubble a bust and a resurrection and it's a story that
            helps explain why despite what we may think even the worst financial meltdowns are incredibly amazingly and
            unexpectedly a good thing for all of us it's almost a cliche but if you're searching for the next big thing
            in high-tech best place to look is a garage , yes the almighty garage the place where according to high-tech
            lore the greatest startups were incubated hewlett-packard ,Apple the list goes on and on the garage were
            interested in today was the birthplace of amazon.com it was in suburban Seattle and belonged to a guy named
            Jeff Bezos started out on Wall Street in the early 1990s he
            was highly analytical a spreadsheet junkie and when the web came along he started thinking in a systematic
            way about its unique properties and what kinds of stuff it would be ideal for selling he made a list after
            list and
            always at the top it was books there are millions of books active and imprint around the world and you could
            build something online that just couldn't exist any other way there's no way to have a physical bookstore
            with millions of titles Bezos launched Amazon in the summer of 1995 around the same time down in Silicon
            Valley.</p>

        <p>Over the second half of 1999, it wasn’t a question of whether or not a bubble existed, it was a question of
            how big a bubble it was, and when it would pop. Most people knew it was unsustainable, but no one wanted to
            admit it. If you could squeeze your IPO out before the window closed, then you could pick your moment to
            cash out, hopefully before everyone else got the same idea.</p>
        <p>One by one, the weakest of the dot-coms began to underperform. Dot-coms ceased being sure stock market
            winners — in a trickle, and then all at once. Falling stock prices turned into stock market delistings and
            then became actual bankruptcies. On January 14, 2000, the Dow Jones Industrial Average peaked at 11,722.98,
            a level it would not return to for more than six years. The tech-heavy Nasdaq peaked on March 10, 2000, at
            5,048.62, a level it would not reach again until March 2015. From that March 2000 peak, all the way down to
            the trough it reached on October 9, 2002 (the bear market bottom would be 1,114.11, the Nasdaq would lose
            nearly 80 percent of its value.</p>

        <p>This is what the Internet's all about the Internet's about connecting individuals or connecting individuals
            to information outside Silicon Valley it's true you won't find as much consensus that we're entering a
            digital golden age but in a way that may be the strongest testament to how far the web and e-commerce in
            particular have come in the past decade the futurist John Seely Brown once observed that when a technology
            achieves amenity when it becomes ubiquitous and essential it disappears it becomes invisible think of
            electricity think of airplanes and automobiles and air-conditioning like the railroad tracks crossing the
            country the web is becoming the foundation of our economy carrying us along to our destination so smoothly
            and efficiently we don't even realize how fast we're moving.</p>
