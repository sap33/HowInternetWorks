    <p><i class='fas fa-hand-point-right'></i><strong style="padding-left: 0.5%;">Packets</strong></p>
    <p>
        In networking, a packet is a small segment of a larger message. Data sent over computer networks*, such as the
        Internet, is divided into packets. These packets are then recombined by the computer or device that receives
        them.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the Internet, the network breaks an e-mail message into parts of a certain size in bytes. These are the
        packets.
        Each packet carries the information that will help it get to its destination -- the sender's IP address, the
        intended receiver's IP address, something that tells the network how many packets this e-mail message has been
        broken into and the number of this particular packet. The packets carry the data in the protocols that the
        Internet
        uses: Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). Each packet contains part of the body of your
        message. A typical packet contains perhaps 1,000 or 1,500 bytes.
    </p>
    <div class="class-img-margin">
        <img src="images/Packets1.jpg" class="mx-auto d-block">
    </div>
    <p><i class='fas fa-hand-point-right'></i><strong style="padding-left: 0.5%;">Packet Structure</strong></p>
    <p>Most network packets are split into three parts:</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Header</strong> - The header contains instructions about the data carried by the packet. These
        instructions
        may include
        Length of packet (some networks have fixed-length packets, while others rely on the header to contain this
        information)
        Synchronization (a few bits that help the packet match up to the network)
        Packet number (which packet this is in a sequence of packets)
        Protocol (on networks that carry multiple types of information, the protocol defines what type of packet is
        being
        transmitted: e-mail, Web page, streaming video)
        Destination address (where the packet is going)
        Originating address (where the packet came from)
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Payload</strong> - Also called the body or data of a packet. This is the actual data that the packet is
        delivering to the
        destination. If a packet is fixed-length, then the payload may be padded with blank information to make it the
        right
        size.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Trailer</strong> - The trailer, sometimes called the footer, typically contains a couple of bits that
        tell
        the receiving device
        that it has reached the end of the packet. It may also have some type of error checking. The most common error
        checking
        used in packets is Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC). CRC is pretty neat. Here is how it works in certain computer
        networks:
        It takes the sum of all the 1s in the payload and adds them together. The result is stored as a hexadecimal
        value in
        the
        trailer. The receiving device adds up the 1s in the payload and compares the result to the value stored in the
        trailer.
        If the values match, the packet is good. But if the values do not match, the receiving device sends a request to
        the
        originating device to resend the packet.
    </p>
    <p>
        As an example, let's look at how an e-mail message might get broken into packets. Let's say that you send an
        e-mail
        to a friend. The e-mail is about 3,500 bits (3.5 kilobits) in size. The network you send it over uses
        fixed-length
        packets of 1,024 bits (1 kilobit). The header of each packet is 96 bits long and the trailer is 32 bits long,
        leaving 896 bits for the payload. To break the 3,500 bits of message into packets, you will need four packets
        (divide 3,500 by 896). Three packets will contain 896 bits of payload and the fourth will have 812 bits. Here is
        what one of the four packets would contain:
    </p>
    <p>
        Each packet's header will contain the proper protocols, the originating address (the IP address of your
        computer),
        the destination address (the IP address of the computer where you are sending the e-mail) and the packet number
        (1,
        2, 3 or 4 since there are 4 packets). Routers in the network will look at the destination address in the header
        and
        compare it to their lookup table to find out where to send the packet. Once the packet arrives at its
        destination,
        your friend's computer will strip the header and trailer off each packet and reassemble the e-mail based on the
        numbered sequence of the packets.

    <p><i class='fas fa-hand-point-right'></i><strong style="padding-left: 0.5%;">Routing</strong></p>
    <p>
        Network routing is the process of selecting a path across one or more networks. The principles of routing can
        apply to
        any type of network, from telephone networks to public transportation. In packet-switching networks, such as the
        Internet, routing selects the paths for Internet Protocol (IP) packets to travel from their origin to their
        destination.
        These Internet routing decisions are made by specialized pieces of network hardware called routers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Consider the image below. For a data packet to get from Computer A to Computer B, should it pass through
        networks 1, 3,
        and 5 or networks 2 and 4? The packet will take a shorter path through networks 2 and 4, but networks 1, 3, and
        5 might
        be faster at forwarding packets than 2 and 4. These are the kinds of choices network routers constantly make.
    </p>
    <div class="class-img-margin">
        <img src="images/Routing1.jpg" class="mx-auto d-block">
    </div>
    <p><i class='fas fa-hand-point-right'></i><strong style="padding-left: 0.5%;">How does routing work?</strong></p>
    <p>
        Routers refer to internal routing tables to make decisions about how to route packets along network paths. A
        routing
        table records the paths that packets should take to reach every destination that the router is responsible for.
        Think of train timetables, which train passengers consult to decide which train to catch. Routing tables are
        like
        that, but for network paths rather than trains.
    </p>
    <p>
        Routers work in the following way: when a router receives a packet, it reads the headers* of the packet to see
        its
        intended destination, like the way a train conductor may check a passenger's tickets to determine which train
        they
        should go on. It then determines where to route the packet based on information in its routing tables.
    </p>
    <p>
    Routers do this millions of times a second with millions of packets. As a packet travels to its destination, it may
    be routed several times by different routers.
    </p>
    <p>
    Routing tables can either be static or dynamic. Static routing tables do not change. A network administrator
    manually sets up static routing tables. This essentially sets in stone the routes data packets take across the
    network, unless the administrator manually updates the tables.
    </p>
    <p>
    Dynamic routing tables update automatically. Dynamic routers use various routing protocols (see below) to determine
    the shortest and fastest paths. They also make this determination based on how long it takes packets to reach their
    destination — similar to the way Google Maps, Waze, and other GPS services determine the best driving routes based
    on past driving performance and current driving conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
    Dynamic routing requires more computing power, which is why smaller networks may rely on static routing. But for
    medium-sized and large networks, dynamic routing is much more efficient.
    </p>
    <p>
    Packet headers are small bundles of data attached to packets that provide useful information, including where the
    packet is coming from and where it is headed, like the packing slip stamped on the outside of a mail parcel.
